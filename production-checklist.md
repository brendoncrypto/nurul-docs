# Production Readiness Checklist

This document outlines the steps needed to ensure the Nurul application is ready for production deployment.

## Environment Configuration

- [ ] Create a `.env.production` file with all required environment variables
- [ ] Ensure Supabase production credentials are secured and not committed to git
- [ ] Set up proper environment variables in the deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- [ ] Validate that local development uses different databases/resources than production

## Authentication & Security

- [ ] Audit authentication flows to ensure they work in production environment
- [ ] Implement proper CORS policies for API routes
- [ ] Remove any development or testing backdoors (like placeholder user IDs)
- [ ] Ensure all API routes validate user authentication properly
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API routes
- [ ] Set up proper CSP headers

## Database

- [ ] Finalize database schema migrations
- [ ] Back up any existing production data before migrations
- [ ] Ensure database indexes are optimized for production queries
- [ ] Set up proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- [ ] Implement database connection pooling if needed

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Run Lighthouse audits and fix critical performance issues
- [ ] Implement image optimization with next/image
- [ ] Verify that no production-impacting console.log statements remain
- [ ] Consider implementing ISR/SSG for static or semi-static pages
- [ ] Test loading times with throttled connections
- [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading where appropriate

## Error Handling

- [ ] Set up proper error boundaries for React components
- [ ] Implement graceful fallbacks for API failures
- [ ] Configure error logging service (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Create custom 404 and 500 error pages
- [ ] Remove development-only error details from production responses

## User Experience

- [ ] Test all user flows on multiple devices and browsers
- [ ] Ensure accessibility standards are met (run axe or similar tools)
- [ ] Verify that all interactive elements have appropriate loading states
- [ ] Implement analytics tracking for key user actions
- [ ] Test form submissions and validations

## Deployment

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Configure build caching for faster deployments
- [ ] Set up staging environment that mirrors production
- [ ] Create deployment rollback plan
- [ ] Document deployment process

## Monitoring & Maintenance

- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated database backups
- [ ] Document maintenance procedures

## Legal & Compliance

- [ ] Ensure Privacy Policy is up to date
- [ ] Verify Terms of Service are complete
- [ ] Implement cookie consent if necessary (GDPR)
- [ ] Check WCAG compliance for accessibility

## Final Checks

- [ ] Remove all TODO comments and placeholder content
- [ ] Verify all environment-specific code (development vs production)
- [ ] Run a final security audit
- [ ] Test production build locally before deployment
- [ ] Document known issues and their workarounds

## Post-Launch

- [ ] Set up alerting for critical issues
- [ ] Monitor initial user feedback
- [ ] Plan for regular maintenance updates
- [ ] Document lessons learned for future deployments
